The process of updating these elements to enable continued tracking is called maintenance. Without it, terms can become:
unreachable: no snapshot can be recorded at all, because the location changed or the service denies access; unextractable: no version can be extracted from the snapshot, because the selection of content or some filter fails; noisy: both snapshots and versions are recorded but the changes contain noise that should have been filtered out.</description></item><item><title>Range selectors</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/terms/explanation/range-selectors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/terms/explanation/range-selectors/</guid><description>Range selectors ðŸ”— When no unique wrapper element exists for the whole terms content, there is no easy way to select the content with only CSS selectors. Content between two elements in a document can be selected using a range selector, regardless of their DOM position. The concept is inspired by the DOM Range API, where content is defined by start and end points that may be included or excluded.</description></item></channel></rss>
