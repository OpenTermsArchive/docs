# Open Terms Archive documentation

Open Terms Archive is a decentralised system that tracks collections of services' terms across multiple servers. Each collection exposes the data it collects through datasets and through its own API. The Federation API unifies search and discovery across collections.

## Required minimal terminology

Before diving into the details, let's first understand the essential terminology used throughout this documentation.

- **Terms:** the contractual documents published by services (such as Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Community Guidelines…) that users agree to.
- **Collection:** a set of tracked terms grouped by a specific scope (such as language, jurisdiction, industry…).
- **Declaration:** a JSON file that defines which terms to track for a service and how to track them.
- **Snapshot:** the original source document (HTML, PDF…) from which the terms will be extracted.
- **Version:** the textual content of the terms after filtering out irrelevant content (navigation menu, advertisements…) from a snapshot.
