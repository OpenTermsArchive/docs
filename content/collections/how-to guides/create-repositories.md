# How to create collection repositories

Collections in Open Terms Archive rely on three Git repositories to hold the data:
- Declarations repository: stores the declarations that define terms to track
- Snapshots repository: stores raw snapshots of tracked terms
- Versions repository: stores processed versions of tracked terms

This guide assumes you use GitHub. For other Git platforms, adapt these steps accordingly.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- A GitHub account with permissions to create repositories
- Your collection ID and name defined
- Your collection metadata prepared

## Create declarations repository

### Create from template

1. Go to the [`demo-declarations`](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/demo-declarations) repository
2. Click "Use this template" dropdown and select "Create a new repository"
3. Name it `<collection_id>-declarations` (e.g. `pga-declarations`)
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for automatic setup to complete (check `first-time-setup` action status)

### Configure repository settings

1. Set up the "About" section:
   - Click the cogwheel icon next to "About"
   - Add description: "Declarations for `<collection_name>`. Maintained by `<maintainer>`."
   - Set website: `https://opentermsarchive.org`
   - Add tags: `terms-of-service`, `terms-of-service-agreements`, `terms-and-conditions`, `open-terms-archive`
   - Uncheck "Releases", "Packages" and "Deployments"

2. Configure features:
   - In "General → Features":
     - Disable "Wikis" and "Projects"

   - In "Branches":
     - Add branch protection for `main`
     - Require pull request with 1 approval
     - Require status checks: `validate_modified_declarations` and `validate_schema`
   - In "Actions":
     - Allow all actions and reusable workflows

3. Remove all default labels

   - Update README with collection metadata

   - Set collection icon as avatar
   - Description: "Maintainers of the `<collection_name>` collection"
