# How to create a collection

You are considering creating a new collection to track terms with Open Terms Archive? Amazing!

## Define metadata

First of all, define the [metadata]({{< relref "collections/reference/metadata" >}}) of the collection you would like to create and keep them ready to be used when setting up the repositories.

## Check existing collections

Now that you have a clear idea what you would like to track, double-check that there are no [existing federated collections](https://opentermsarchive.org/#collections) that you could contribute to. If you have a doubt about whether some terms you want to track would fit a collection, reach out to the collection maintainers.

If no existing collection could be a good host for the terms you would like to track, then it is relevant to create your own.

## Inform the community

Starting a new collection is an exciting endeavour, and would strongly benefit from the support of the community who already maintains existing collections. It is strongly recommended to share your intention to create a new collection as early as possible in the process, to get support and identify potential partners.

You can inform the community by posting on the instant messaging system, or [sending an email](mailto:contact@opentermsarchive.org) to the core team.

## Define governance

Setting up and maintaining a collection over time needs fulfilling certain tasks on a regular basis. These tasks are handled through roles. To make sure that all these roles are covered, define the [governance]({{< relref "collections/reference/governance" >}}) of your collection.

At any time, feel free to ask for help or partners in the community.

## Create repositories

See the [guide to create repositories]({{< relref "collections/how-to/create-repositories" >}}) for your collection.
