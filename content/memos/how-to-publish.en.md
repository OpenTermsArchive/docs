If necessary, we will suggest changes and discuss them with you.

If you do not hear from us within two weeks, please do not hesitate to contact us again by the means of your choice.

## 3. Promote

Once the core team has published your memo on [opentermsarchive.org/en/memos](https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/), we will inform you and provide you with the URL address of your memo. You should then promote it through the media and to the people you consider appropriate. Whenever possible, please associate the hashtag `#TermsSpotting` with your memo promotion, in order to provide visibility to the overall Open Terms Archive project and analysis.
