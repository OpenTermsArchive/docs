# Community call

The Open Terms Archive Community Call is a monthly online meeting for and by the community.

## Special edition! Friday, Sept 12 08:00 UTC

We’re back from summer break and kicking off a new season with a special edition of the community call. Join us to meet new team members, hear about product updates from the summer, and discover what’s coming next for Open Terms Archive.

## Ambitions

- **Get up-to-date**: the core team will open the call by highlighting the latest features and updates.
- **Discover collections**: on each call, a maintainer will present their collection.
- **Get support**: the core team will be available to help you track and maintain existing collections.
