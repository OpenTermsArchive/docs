2. Clearly defined [collection governance]({{< relref "collections/references/governance" >}}).
3. The vast majority of **versions** are readable, as evidenced by a sample assessment.
4. **Frequency** of at least one track a day, as evidenced by snapshots.
5. Public and open-licensed **declarations**, as evidenced by the `LICENSE` file in the declarations repository.

## Disclaimer

Please note that establishing the federation is an ongoing effort. While criteria are assessed and refined to strike the right balance between accessibility and quality, the Open Terms Archive core team is responsible for assessing which collections may join the federation, and has the right to update the criteria as requests for joining are made.

The core team has the right to re-assess the federated status of any collection at any given time. In case the federated status of a collection is changed, the collection administrator will be informed immediately, and if possible before the action is made.
