# How to join the federation

An official request for joining the federation can be sent by the collection administrator or curator to the core team over email, GitHub or instant messages. That request should contain all necessary content or links that enable assessing the criteria.

The core team will confirm reception of the request and assess the criteria within 4 weeks. The result of the assessment will be provided to the requester through the same means the request was sent, along with a positive decision or a list of improvements that need to be done before a new request can be sent.

Once a positive decision has been issued, the core team will provide the requester with a timeline for joining the federation, on which they will jointly agree.
