# Server specifications

## Minimum Requirements

The minimum recommended server specifications are:

- 2GB RAM
- 1CPU @ 2GHz
- 10GB storage

Approximately 750MB of storage is required for the engine itself, with the remaining space allocated for data generated by the engine.

## Storage Growth

Storage requirements typically grow at a rate of less than 0.5MB per tracked terms per month on average. This growth rate varies depending on the type of service being tracked:

- Large digital services, like those in the [PGA collection](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-declarations): ~1MB per terms per month
- Standard collections: ~0.1-0.3MB per terms per month

## Operating System Requirements

Supported operating systems:
- Ubuntu 20.04 or higher
- Debian 11 or higher

## Geographic Requirements

Servers must be deployed in geographic regions that align with the jurisdiction the collection targets. This is crucial because some services deliver different versions of documents based on the server's location, even when the documents are supposed to be identical. Therefore, ensure your server is physically located in a country within the jurisdiction that the collection targets.
