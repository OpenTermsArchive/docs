# Server specifications

The minimum server specifications are:

- 2 GB RAM
- 1 CPU @ 2GHz
- 2 GB storage

Approximately 750 MB of storage is required for the engine itself, with the remaining space allocated for data generated by the engine. Storage capacity should be calculated based on the scope and expected lifetime of the collection.

## Storage growth

Storage requirements typically grow at a rate of less than 0.5MB per tracked terms per month on average. This growth rate varies depending on the type of service being tracked:

- Very large online platforms with large legal teams and heavy layouts: ~1MB per terms per month
- Standard collections: ~0.1-0.3MB per terms per month

## Operating system

Supported operating systems:
- Ubuntu 20.04 or higher
- Debian 11 or higher

## Location

Servers should be physically located in geographic regions that align with the jurisdiction the collection targets to ensure to [obtain documents like a user would]({{< relref "concepts/design-principles#3-obtain-documents-like-a-user-would" >}}). This is crucial because some services deliver different versions of documents based on the location of the request, even when the documents are supposed to be identical.
